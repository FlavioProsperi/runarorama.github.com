My name is Rúnar. I'm a software engineer in Boston, an author of a book, [Functional Programming in Scala](http://manning.com/bjarnason), and an occasional speaker on topics in functional programming.

I received my education in computer programming and electrical engineering at the Reykjavík Technical College in Iceland. In the intervening decades I have done diverse programming work, including antivirus research, software for agriculture and animal breeding, real estate, IT, finance, and genomics. I have worked with many programming languages including Pascal, C, Java, Haskell, Scala, and Ruby, and made some of my own.

I use this blog to write about things that interest me or occupy my attention, including functional programming, relational database theory, compilers, programming languages, and philosophy.

Direct any inquiries to `runar` at this blog's domain.
