{% img left /images/monkeygrinder.png 132 116 Monkey Grinder %}

My name is Rúnar. I'm a software engineer in Boston, an author of a book, [Functional Programming in Scala](http://manning.com/bjarnason), and an occasional speaker on topics in functional programming.

I received my education in computer programming and electrical engineering at the Reykjavík Technical College in Iceland. In the intervening decades I have done diverse programming work, including antivirus research, software for agriculture and animal breeding, real estate, IT, and finance. I have worked with many programming languages including Pascal, C, Java, Haskell, Scala, and Ruby, and made some of my own.

I use this blog to write about things that interest me or occupy my attention, including functional programming, relational database theory, compilers, programming languages, and philosophy.

My views are my own and not my employer's.
