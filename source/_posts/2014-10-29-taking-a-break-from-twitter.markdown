Today I disabled my Twitter account. Probably only temporarily, but we'll see. This is just a quick note to let everyone know that I'm not leaving Twitter because of anything specific. It's not that you said or did anything wrong. I just find that it's becoming an energy sink for me. I'm putting Twitter away as a measure to control my focus, and to better control what information I consume and produce.

Hopefully this means that I will post more here when I have something interesting to share. If you need to reach me, I'm available by email. My address is `runar` at this blog's domain.

(UPDATE 2014-12-21): I've recreated my Twitter account, but I'm now using the service in a different way. The biggest change is that I don't follow anyone. It's strictly a broadcasting device for me, and not an information consumption device.
