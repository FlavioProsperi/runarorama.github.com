I have not seriously updated the [old Apocalisp blog](http://apocalisp.wordpress.com) for quite some time. Mostly this is due to the fact that I have been spending all of my creative time outside of work on [writing a book](http://manning.com/bjarnason). It's also partly that putting a post up on WordPress is a chore. It's like building a ship in a bottle.

So I have decided to make posting really easy for myself by hosting the blog [on GitHub](http://github.com/runarorama/runarorama.github.com). I am using a dead-simple markdown-based framework called [Octopress](http://octopress.org). With this setup I can very easily write a new post from my command line and publish by pushing to GitHub. This is already part of my normal coding workflow, so it feels more friction-free.

The new blog is simply titled "Higher Order", and is available at [blog.higher-order.com](http://blog.higher-order.com). Check back soon for posts that I've been sitting on but have been too ~~lazy~~ busy to post.

All of the old content and comments will still be available at the old address, and I'll probably cross-post to both places for a little while.
